## System Architecture
XNRT utilizes a robust architecture designed for performance, scalability, and security.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System**: Unified cosmic theme system with black starfield background in both light and dark modes. Golden twinkling stars in light mode, white twinkling stars in dark mode. Landing page features luxurious golden color palette (amber-to-yellow gradients) for premium brand feel with light text for visibility.
- **Authentication Experience**: Glassmorphic `/auth` page with backdrop-blur effects, tabbed Login/Register interface, and framer-motion animations (card entrance, logo spring, tab transitions, button interactions).
- **Error Handling**: An ErrorBoundary component provides graceful failure recovery with user-friendly fallback UI for all authenticated routes.
- **Loading States**: Content-aware skeleton screens are used for improved perceived performance during data fetching.
- **Confirmation Flows**: Critical actions require user confirmation with detailed transaction information.
- **Components**: Leverages Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives for accessible and responsive design.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach ensuring usability across devices.
- **Animations**: Framer-motion is used for dynamic UI elements and transitions throughout the application.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for data management.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) using Drizzle ORM for schema definition and session management, and Prisma ORM for database operations.
- **Authentication**: Hybrid system supporting Replit OIDC (Passport.js) and traditional email/password, with secure password reset and session management. All pages use centralized `useAuth()` hook querying `/auth/me` for consistent user state and cache invalidation.
- **PWA**: Full Progressive Web App capabilities via vite-plugin-pwa with custom service worker (injectManifest strategy) for offline SPA routing support. Custom sw.ts implements NavigationRoute without allowlist restrictions, enabling offline access to all routes (/staking, /mining, /referrals). Workbox caching strategies for fonts (Google Fonts), static assets, API responses, icons, and manifest. Configured with devOptions for full PWA functionality in development mode. App shortcuts enable quick access to Staking, Mining, and Referrals from the device home screen. Custom XNRT branded icon integrated across all PWA touchpoints. Manifest served as .webmanifest (W3C standard). Custom branded install prompt with 7-day snooze (timestamp-based persistence), polished update notification system with user-controlled updates via SKIP_WAITING message, and Badging API integration displaying unread notification count on app icon (Android, Windows, ChromeOS).
- **Monitoring**: Optional Sentry integration for error tracking and Web Vitals monitoring.
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management system with tabs for Overview, Deposits, Withdrawals, Users, Analytics, and Settings. Includes bulk deposit approval with sequential processing to prevent race conditions.
- **Deposit System**: USDT to XNRT conversion with admin approval, proof of payment image upload (base64, 5MB max), inline thumbnail preview, and transaction tracking.
- **Withdrawal System**: XNRT to USDT conversion with 2% fee, multi-source support (main, staking, mining, referral balances), 5000 XNRT minimum for mining/referral sources, and admin approval.
- **Staking System**: Four-tiered system with varying APY and duration, featuring real-time countdowns and automated daily reward distribution.
- **Mining System**: 24-hour sessions with ad boosts, XP to XNRT conversion, and automated reward distribution.
- **Referral System**: 3-level commission chain (6%/3%/1%) with network visualization, real-time notifications, a leaderboard, separate balance tracking, and social sharing features.
- **Daily Check-in System**: Atomic check-ins with streak rewards, calendar view showing monthly grid with check-in history, and anti-exploit measures.
- **Achievement System**: Auto-unlocks achievements based on user actions with XP rewards and confetti celebrations.
- **XP Leaderboard System**: Weekly/monthly rankings with category filters (Overall, Mining, Staking, Referrals), top 10 display with trophy icons.
- **Push Notification System**: Web Push notifications with VAPID authentication, subscription management, delivery tracking with exponential backoff retry logic (5/15/30/60 min delays, max 5 attempts), offline queueing, and event triggers for achievements, deposits, referrals, staking rewards, and mining completion.
- **Password Reset System**: Secure password recovery with cryptographically random, time-limited, and one-time-use tokens, plus rate limiting.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Automation**: All core earning mechanisms are fully automated.
- **Security**: Implemented `requireAuth`/`requireAdmin` middleware, atomic database operations, input validation, rate limiting, and `helmet` for security hardening.

### Technical Improvements
- **Service Worker Cache Fix**: Implemented cache versioning system (CACHE_VERSION v3) with custom activate handler to delete old caches, preventing stale bundle issues. Changed JS/CSS bundles from CacheFirst to StaleWhileRevalidate strategy - serves cached content immediately while refreshing in background, eliminating "React is null" errors from outdated cached bundles while maintaining offline functionality. All cache names now include version prefix for proper invalidation.
- **Project Structure Cleanup**: Deleted duplicate root `public/` directory (removed 6 bloated 1.1MB icons, kept optimized versions in `client/public/`). Organized all documentation into `/docs` directory (DEPLOYMENT.md, design_guidelines.md, README.md, replit.md). Grouped auth pages into `client/src/pages/auth/` subdirectory (auth.tsx, login.tsx, register.tsx, forgot-password.tsx, reset-password.tsx) with updated import paths. Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file (was missing). Config files kept in root as required by build tools (vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, etc.).
- **Race Condition Fix**: Changed bulk deposit approval from parallel (Promise.allSettled) to sequential processing (for-of loop), preventing balance corruption when multiple deposits for same user.
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript errors resolved, 100% type-safe implementation across push notification system.
- **Production Ready**: Deployment configuration verified (autoscale), all workflows running without errors.

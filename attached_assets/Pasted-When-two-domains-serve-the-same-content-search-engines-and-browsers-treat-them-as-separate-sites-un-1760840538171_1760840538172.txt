When two domains serve the same content, search engines and browsers treat them as separate sites unless you explicitly designate a canonical version. MDN’s URI guide notes that you should “choose one [domain] and stick with it” to make your site appear consistent to users and search engines
developer.mozilla.org
. It then recommends two canonicalization techniques:

HTTP 301 redirect – configure the server to return a permanent 301 response for the non‑canonical host and point it at the canonical host
developer.mozilla.org
. This tells browsers and search engines that the resource has permanently moved, consolidating link equity and traffic on the canonical domain.

rel="canonical" tags – add a <link rel="canonical"> tag in the page head to signal the preferred URL
developer.mozilla.org
. This is useful when you cannot redirect but still want to avoid duplicate‑content penalties; however, a 301 redirect is stronger because it forces all requests onto the canonical domain.

Cookies are also tied to the domain that sets them. The Set‑Cookie specification explains that the Domain attribute defines which host (and optional subdomains) may receive the cookie; multiple domain values are not allowed
developer.mozilla.org
. A cookie set for one domain will be rejected if it doesn’t match the requesting host
developer.mozilla.org
. In practice, this means a user who logs in at xnrt.org will not automatically be logged in when switching to xnrt.replit.app because the session cookie only applies to one domain. Consolidating users onto a single host avoids these session splits.

Given these points, the safest and most maintainable practice is to choose a single canonical domain (e.g., xnrt.org) and implement a 301 redirect from the other host (xnrt.replit.app) to it. This prevents duplicate‑content penalties, avoids splitting analytics and session cookies across domains, and provides a clear, consistent entry point for users. You can still keep both domains live for branding or convenience, but all absolute links and bookmarks should point to the canonical domain.

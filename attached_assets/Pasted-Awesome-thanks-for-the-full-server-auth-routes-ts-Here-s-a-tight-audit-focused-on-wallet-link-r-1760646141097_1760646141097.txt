Awesome—thanks for the full **server/auth/routes.ts**. Here’s a tight audit focused on wallet-link reliability, cookies, and anything that could cause the “challenge”/session hiccups you saw.

# What’s solid

* Uses `isProd ? 'none' : 'lax'` for **`sid`** and **`csrfToken`** cookies ✅ (required for MetaMask/Trust Wallet webviews).
* `httpOnly` on session cookie ✅
* Email verify autologin path mirrors login cookie settings ✅
* Rate limiting and zod validation ✅

# Small but important fixes

1. ## Make `clearCookie` match the cookie’s options

Browsers only remove a cookie if the **attributes match** how it was set (domain/sameSite/secure). In logout you currently call:

```ts
res.clearCookie('sid');
```

If the user logged in on production (sameSite:'none', secure:true), this may fail to clear the cookie in some webviews.

**Fix**

```ts
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
res.clearCookie('sid', {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: isProd,
  sameSite: isProd ? 'none' : 'lax',
});
```

Do the same anywhere you might clear `csrfToken` later.

2. ## (Optional) Set a cookie **domain** if you use multiple hostnames

If you ever serve both `xnrt.org` and `www.xnrt.org`, add `domain: '.xnrt.org'` for both `sid` and `csrfToken`. Otherwise a user who logs in on one host won’t be authenticated on the other.

```ts
const domain = isProd ? '.xnrt.org' : undefined;
res.cookie('sid', token, { httpOnly:true, secure:isProd, sameSite:isProd ? 'none' : 'lax', maxAge:..., domain });
```

(Only add this if you truly need apex + www; otherwise leave it out.)

3. ## Ensure CORS and cookie settings line up

Your `server/index.ts` sets:

```ts
app.use(cors({ origin: CLIENT_URL, credentials: true }));
```

Make sure `CLIENT_URL` equals the **exact** origin used in the browser (e.g. `https://xnrt.org`). If you accept multiple (local, prod, www), switch to a small allow-list function (I can share a snippet) so credentialed requests (cookies) are sent consistently.

4. ## Future-proof: Helmet CSP frameSrc

If/when you bring WalletConnect modal/iframes, you’ll need `frameSrc: ["'self'", "https:"]` (right now it’s `"'none'"` in production CSP). Not urgent today, just a heads-up.

# Why this matters for your linking flow

* The “Failed to generate challenge” you previously saw was most likely due to **session cookies not being accepted** in a specific webview context (sameSite/secure/domain/CORS mismatch).
* You proved the flow works when opened inside MetaMask browser (where cookies were accepted) and via the manual flow. Good news: the core logic is sound.

# What I’d like next (so I can review the full link flow)

Please share these three files so I can finish a line-by-line on the wallet endpoints:

1. **`server/routes.ts`** (where `/api/wallet/link/challenge` & `/api/wallet/link/confirm` live)
2. **`server/auth/middleware.ts`** (`requireAuth`, how `req.authUser` gets attached, any CSRF check)
3. **`server/services/db.ts`** or the Prisma “nonce” storage if you already moved to DB-backed nonces

With those I’ll:

* Verify the challenge message/nonce issuance & expiry
* Ensure CSRF is validated *only* where needed (confirm step)
* Suggest DB-backed nonce (bulletproof across webviews) if you want to harden more

If you prefer, I can also drop in the **logout clearCookie patch** and a **multi-origin CORS allow-list** snippet ready to paste.

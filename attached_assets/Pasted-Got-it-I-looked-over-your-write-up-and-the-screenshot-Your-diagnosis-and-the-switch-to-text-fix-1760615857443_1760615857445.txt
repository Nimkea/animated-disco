Got it—I looked over your write-up and the screenshot. Your diagnosis and the “switch to `text`” fix are correct. Here’s a quick review plus a few upgrades so you don’t trade one problem for another.

## What you got right

* The failure is because prod already contains `transactionHash` values longer than 66; shrinking to `varchar(66)` fails. ✅
* Migrating both `transactionHash` and `walletAddress` to `text` removes the length constraint and deploys safely. ✅

## What I’d improve (safe + future-proof)

1. **Keep flexibility but enforce format with a CHECK constraint**

   * EVM tx hashes are exactly 66 chars (`0x` + 64 hex). Addresses are 42 chars.
   * Use `text` for migration safety, then add *validation* at the DB so garbage can’t creep back in.

   ```sql
   -- add constraints without blocking writes
   ALTER TABLE "Transaction"
     ADD CONSTRAINT tx_hash_format
     CHECK ("transactionHash" ~ '^0x[0-9A-Fa-f]{64}$') NOT VALID;

   ALTER TABLE "Transaction"
     ADD CONSTRAINT wallet_addr_format
     CHECK ("walletAddress" ~ '^0x[0-9A-Fa-f]{40}$') NOT VALID;

   -- validate in a follow-up step to avoid long locks
   ALTER TABLE "Transaction" VALIDATE CONSTRAINT tx_hash_format;
   ALTER TABLE "Transaction" VALIDATE CONSTRAINT wallet_addr_format;
   ```

   *Why:* You keep the easy migration (`text`) while preventing future bad data.

2. **Inspect and clean the outliers before validating**

   ```sql
   SELECT id, "transactionHash"
   FROM "Transaction"
   WHERE length("transactionHash") <> 66
      OR "transactionHash" !~ '^0x[0-9A-Fa-f]{64}$';

   SELECT id, "walletAddress"
   FROM "Transaction"
   WHERE length("walletAddress") <> 42
      OR "walletAddress" !~ '^0x[0-9A-Fa-f]{40}$';
   ```

   * Decide whether to fix, delete, or quarantine those rows. Don’t blindly `LEFT(...,66)` unless you’re sure it’s junk.

3. **Indexing/uniqueness (if applicable)**

   * If these are identifiers, make them unique to prevent duplicates:

   ```sql
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_transaction_hash_unique
     ON "Transaction" ("transactionHash");
   ```

   * `text` is fine for a btree index in Postgres.

4. **App-layer validation**

   * Add a simple regex check in your ORM/models so bad data never reaches the DB.
   * Trim whitespace before inserts/updates.

5. **Migration order**

   * Keep it in two steps if you’re adding constraints:

     1. `ALTER ... TYPE text` (deploy)
     2. Clean bad rows, add `CHECK ... NOT VALID`, `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` (deploy)

## TL;DR next actions

1. Deploy the `text` migration you wrote (good).
2. Query and fix the bad rows.
3. Add the `CHECK` constraints (NOT VALID → VALIDATE).
4. (Optional) Add `UNIQUE` indexes if these fields are keys.

That will get you unblocked now and protect you from the same issue later.

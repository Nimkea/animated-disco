MINING SYSTEM V3 (HYBRID CONTINUOUS APPROACH)

MINING CYCLE (24 HOURS)

* User taps "Start Mining" to begin.
* Mining runs automatically for 24 hours.
* App can be closed; progress continues in the background.
* Display shows: "Mining Active – 18h 42m remaining."
* Base reward is locked at the start (e.g., 10 XNRT + 10 XP).
* User can watch ads anytime during the 24-hour cycle to increase total rewards.

AD BOOST SYSTEM

* Each ad watched grants a +10% reward boost.
* Maximum 10 ads per mining cycle (+100% total boost).
* Boosts apply cumulatively to the base reward.
* Example: 10 XNRT × 1.40 = 14 XNRT total for +40% boost.
* Real-time boost display: "4/10 Ads Watched (+40% Boost Active)."

REWARD CALCULATION (AT CYCLE END)

* When the 24-hour timer completes:

  * Rewards = Base × (1 + Total Boost%).
  * Example: 10 XNRT × 1.50 = 15 XNRT.
* Message: "Mining Complete! 15 XNRT + 10 XP earned."
* Rewards are automatically added to the user’s balance.
* Mining button resets to "Start New Mining Session."

COOLDOWN & LIMITS

* No cooldown — can start a new session immediately after rewards are granted.
* Only one active mining session at a time.
* Mining progress and boosts are tracked server-side to prevent manipulation.

INTERFACE ELEMENTS

* Mining History:

  * Log of last 10 sessions with rewards and boost percentages.

BALANCING & ENGAGEMENT CONTROLS

* User forgets to watch ads → Send gentle reminders: "Mining in progress — watch ads to boost rewards!"
* Needs motivation to return → Use a Boost Meter that fills visually as ads are watched.
* Too idle – feels passive → Add light daily goals: "Watch 3 ads today for +15% bonus."
* Reward inflation risk → Limit total boost to +100% per cycle.

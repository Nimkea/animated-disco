## Test User Investigation

### Staking History Issue (RESOLVED)
**User Report:** "Staking history not shown"  
**Investigation Results:**
- Test user (test@xnrt.org) has ZERO stakes in database (neither active nor withdrawn)
- The empty state "No stake history yet - Your withdrawn stakes will appear here" is **CORRECT behavior**
- Another user (Noah) has an active Mythic Diamond stake (200 XNRT, 730% APY) confirming the system works
- **Conclusion:** User's issue was expected behavior, not a bug

### Database Verification
```sql
SELECT * FROM "Stake" WHERE userId = '3284f7d0-0395-4c1c-badf-1fc92e061421';
-- Result: Empty (0 rows)

SELECT * FROM "Stake" WHERE id = '541d5e64-6c89-4f11-b4b2-7f850cf23dad';
-- Result: Active stake for user Noah (noahkeaneowen@outlook.com)
```

## Known Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **401 on Landing Page (Expected)**
   - `/auth/me` endpoint called before login
   - This is normal behavior for auth state checking
   - No functional impact

2. **404 Errors for Missing Resources (Expected)**
   - Service worker offline caching working as designed
   - Resources correctly cached or skipped

3. **Autocomplete Attribute Warning**
   - Browser suggests adding `autocomplete="current-password"` to password inputs
   - Low priority UX enhancement

4. **LSP Type Errors (Non-blocking)**
   - Location: server/routes.ts (Prisma types)
   - Cause: TypeScript language server not reloading after Prisma generation
   - Impact: LSP errors only, runtime code works correctly
   - Status: Prisma client regenerated, code functional

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions: NONE
All critical systems are operational and secure.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add `autocomplete` attributes to form inputs for better UX
2. Implement automated E2E tests using the test script created
3. Consider load testing for concurrent users
4. Add more achievement categories
5. Expand staking tiers beyond current 4

## Test Deliverables

1. **API Test Results:** 30+ endpoints verified working
2. **Security Fixes:** Rate limiter trust proxy issue resolved
3. **UI Fixes:** React key warning eliminated
4. **Documentation:**
